Scenario 1: Native, web or hybrid app

Prologue
For this scenario, we decided to go with a Hybrid app approach. This decision aims to achieve wider platform coverage and quicker development, while accepting a potential trade-off in native performance.
Discussion/Context
The goal is to develop an app that caters to both iOS and Android users, keeping in mind the budget and timeline. The app should provide a seamless user experience, enabling features like offline browsing, notifications, and easy payments.
Solution
For our hybrid app, using a framework like React Native enables us to create one app for both iOS and Android. This approach is cost-effective and speeds up the development process, ensuring a reasonable user experience and access to necessary features.
Consequences
Over time, a Hybrid app will facilitate easier updates and maintenance due to a shared codebase. However, there may be scenarios where platform-specific optimizations are required to ensure a consistent user experience. Continuous monitoring of app performance and user feedback will guide future optimizations. Revisiting this decision may be necessary as new technologies emerge or if performance metrics indicate a need for a more native approach.
Technical Concerns:
Platform Coverage: Essential to reach a wide user base.
Cost and Development Speed: Hybrid approach is a balanced choice.
Performance: Ensuring good performance while having a shared codebase.
Access to Native Features: Necessary for crucial app functionalities.
Budget and Timing:
Staying within budget and meeting the release timeline are critical.
User Satisfaction:
Providing an intuitive and reliable app experience is crucial for user retention.
Framework Selection:
React Native is chosen for its community support and ability to provide a near-native performance with a shared codebase.
Provision for using some native code for performance-critical components.
Future Maintenance:
Easier to update or fix the app with a shared codebase.
Performance Monitoring:
Continuous performance monitoring to identify areas of improvement.
User Feedback:
Collecting user feedback for future optimizations.
Reviewing the Decision:
Possible re-evaluation of the decision based on new technologies or performance metrics.
